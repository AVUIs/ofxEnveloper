#ofxEnvRec
ofxEnvRec converts gestures into an envelope type of graphical information, by recognising inflection points from the gesture. Thresholds for horizontal and vertical lines can also be defined. It is particularly aimed for animation and sound applications, and for use with drawing surfaces (such as Wacom tablets or touchscreen interfaces). 

Possible uses:
- audio effect or EQ envelopes;
- animation curves;
- creation/manipulation of audio and/or visual sequences;
- arpeggiators.

Compatibility: openFrameworks 0.9.0

#How it works
Once a gesture is completed, the getEnvelope() method can be executed. 
The getPoints() method can then be used to retrieve the envelope points. 
Gesture and interpolation can be drawn while gesture is executed. 
The clear() method clears the envelope recognition.

#Example
The example-scaling illustrates how a gesture can result in a scaled envelope.
How to run the example:
- Use projectGenerator to create a new project
- Select the addons: ofxEnvRec, ofxMSACore, ofxMSAInterpolator 
- Replace the resulting src folder with the example's src folder
